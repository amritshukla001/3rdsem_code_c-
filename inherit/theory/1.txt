Inheritance:

Consider a class A(data members-x and y) and member function:disp()

B(z and p())
B ob
ob.disp()

If B derives A,all the members of A are inherited in B

Here A is the base class(parent) and B is the derived class(child)

Properties:
--->enhances code reusability

while invoking disp() function of class A from class B:
we an override methods or else we can use the same code


--->method overriding:if we want to modift the function

The class which derives is child class
and the class from which it derives is parent class

Types Of Inheritance: single,multiple,hybrid,multilevel,hierarchial

Single Inheritance:

A->B

Syntax of Base Class:  class base_class {
				//body of the base_class
			}
			class derived_class :: visibility_mode base_class {
				//body of the derived class
			}
