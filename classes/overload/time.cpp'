Description:
Write a program in C++ to create a class named TIME that stores two time values in hours (float) and minutes (integer). Perform the following operations by using a function add():- 

Add T1+T2 where , T1 and T2 are time objects.

 Add T1+x where T1 is a TIME object and x is any integer. 

Return time objects from the member function to main() and display
Algorithm:
STEP 0:  Start
STEP 2:  Declare the class name as Time with data members and member functions.
STEP 3:  Read the choice x,hours minutes from the user.
STEP 4:  The function add() to find the addition of t1 + t2 with minute as integer and hours as float argument.
STEP 5:  The function add() to find the addition of t1+x with minute and x as two integer argument and hour as float.
STEP 6:  Display the user input values also in the output 
STEP 7:  Add the two time functions t1 and t2 to keep it in hours:minutes format
SYEP 8:  Add the two time functions t1 and x to keep it in hours:minutes format
STEP 9:  Stop
