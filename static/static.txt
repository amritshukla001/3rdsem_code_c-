ob1-->object of a class (a and b memeber var.)
ob2-->another object of a class(a and b member var.)

but if a is static then only one space is reserved for a(i. will have only one copy and only one memory will be shared)

class Demo {

	static int a=6;
	//int b=10;

	public:
	static void init();
	//void insert();
}

Static member function can access only the static memebers of a class

Demo :: init() {

	cout << "\nValue : \n" << a;

	//cout << "\nValue : \n" << b;(error as it is accessing non-static data member)
}

ex.

void main() {

	Demo ob[5];
}
