Polymorphic dispatch:

When we call a member function of a class part of a polymorphic hierarchy via a base class pointer,the function is called in run-time.
The called function does not depend upon the pointer but the object the pointer points to.

Compiler works at static time.
At run time the object it actually points to,it generates a code for dynamic-binding.
